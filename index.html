            <h2>Media Query</h2>
            <p>A media query changes the elements based on the size of the viewport.</p>
            <p>It allows the developer more control over the size of elements on a page whether on a small mobile screen
                or a large family TV.</p>

            <p>With just a couple simple css attributes, an image can automatically adjust to best fit the viewport.</p>

            <h2>Retina Displays</h2>
            <p>When pixels are so densely packed that the human eye can't make out any individual pixel at standard
                viewing distance.</p>
            <p>The term "retina display" is mostly a marketing term coined by Apple in 2012.</p>

                "Due to the difference in pixel density between a "Retina" and "Non-Retina" displays, some images that
                have not been made with a High-Resolution Display in mind could look "pixelated" when rendered on a
                High-Resolution display."     -freeCodeCamp
            </blockquote>
            <p>As a result, some lower resolution images may appear much more egregious on a high resolution display and should be scaled down to increase pixel density.</p>
