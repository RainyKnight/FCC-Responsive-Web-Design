            <h2>Media Query</h2>
            <p>A media query changes the elements based on the size of the viewport.</p>
            <p>It allows the developer more control over the size of elements on a page whether on a small mobile screen
                or a large family TV.</p>

            <h1>Responsive Images</h1>
            <p>With just a couple simple css attributes, an image can automatically adjust to best fit the viewport.</p>

            <h2>Retina Displays</h2>
            <p>In newer displays pixels are so densely packed that the human eye can't make out any individual pixel at
                standard
                viewing distance.</p>
            <p>Apple has coined this term "retina display" for marketing purposes back in 2012.</p>

                "Due to the difference in pixel density between a "Retina" and "Non-Retina" displays, some images that
                have not been made with a High-Resolution Display in mind could look "pixelated" when rendered on a
                High-Resolution display." -freeCodeCamp
            </blockquote>
            <p>As a result, it's good practice to scale images down that appear too grainy or pixelated.</p>

                <h3>vh & vw</h3>
                <p class="responsive">Just like images, text should respond correctly to a variety of screen sizes. This
                    can be accomplished with the viewport height &lt;vh&gt; and viewport width &lt;vw&gt; elements</p>

                <h3>vmax & vmin</h3>
                <p>Sometimes developers need to adjust elements to respond to maximum or minimum bounds. The &lt;vmax&gt; and &lt;vmin&gt; units can help achieve this by taking both width <strong>and</strong> height into consideration.</p>
